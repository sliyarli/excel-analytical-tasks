# Excel Practice Tasks (Mock Exams + Final)

This repository contains practical Excel exercises completed during the **INNAB Data Analytics Program**.  
The goal of these exercises was to build speed, accuracy, and clean formula logic when working with structured datasets.

These are not business case studies — they are **targeted technical drills** designed to strengthen core Excel skills used in real analytics workflows.
